# Exception handling a syntatical structure that allows programmers to deal with errors and exceptions in a predictable and manageable way. The structure begins with reserved word begin and ends with end. Inside begin/end, we use rescue which takes a block that will execute and return when an error is raised. This allows the program to continue to run normally instead of exiting at the error/exception line.
#
#
# NOTES FROM LS SOLUTION:
#
# "It is a way of handling the error by changing the flow of control without exiting the program entirely."
