# Calculating the Factorial of N using recursion:
#
# Factorial of n is the result of multiplying numbers 1 to n: 5! is equal to 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
# 
# Iterative Method of Factorial using each loop:
#

def factorial(number)
# this is the number whose factorial we want to find
  number = number

# this is the starting factorial result
  fact = 1

# for each number between 1 to args, multiple that number by the factorial, then save the result as the new factorial.


# set a loop of (1..number) times 
  (1..number).each do |x|
# multiple current result by x, save result as new current result
    fact = fact * x 
  end
  fact
end
