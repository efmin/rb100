You get this error message because the if / end conditional block is not closed. It is missing an "end". To fix this, you add an end. 

Note from LS solution:
  - The end in the code gets matched with the if..else statement. The error message is telling us that the interpreter was expecting the keyword end to close off our method and that that end was not found.
