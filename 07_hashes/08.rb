# Write a program that prints out groups of words that are anagrams. Anagrams are words that have the same exact letters in them but in a different order. Your output should look something like this:
#
# ["demo", "dome", "mode"]
# ["neon", "none"]


words =  ['demo', 'none', 'tied', 'evil', 'dome', 'mode', 'live',
          'fowl', 'veil', 'wolf', 'diet', 'vile', 'edit', 'tide',
          'flow', 'neon']
