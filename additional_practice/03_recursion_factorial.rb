# Calculating the Factorial of N using recursion:
#
# Factorial of n is the result of multiplying numbers 1 to n: 5! is equal to 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
# 
# Iterative Method of Factorial:
#

def factorial(n)
# I want to create n * n-1 * n-2 * n-3 * n-4

# this is the first number to be multiplied (4)
start = n-1 

  i = n
  for i in 1..i-1
      
  end

end

factorial(5)
