# Calculating the Factorial of N using recursion:
#
# Factorial of n is the result of multiplying numbers 1 to n: 5! is equal to 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
# 
# Iterative Method of Factorial:
#

def factorial(number)
# this is the number whose factorial we want to find
  number = number

# this is the starting factorial
  fact = 1

# for each number between 1 to args, multiple that number by the factorial, then save the result as the new factorial.

  (1..number).each do |x|
    puts "x is: #{x}"     
    p fact
    fact = fact * x 
    p fact
  end
  fact
end

p factorial(5)
