a = "e"
b = "A"
c = nil

# So interesting that you can access elements in a string. What does this mean????
#
# NOTES FROM LESSON:
#
# -> Notice that when you reference index of a string beyond the length of the string, the return is nil and not an error.
#
# -> What about for arrays? Same. You get nil not an error.
